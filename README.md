# HaarFeatureFaceDetection
Use of Haar features in an AdaBoost Algorithm to detect faces.
Is very messy, could use clean up.

The zip file contains all the code and the image data necessary to train a strong classifier for face detection.

main.py -> contains wrapper for all code, call main.py on command line with related tags to run code.
